# #30DaysOfKotlin
## GoogleDeveloperTraining-AndroidKotlinFundamentalApps
Build fundamental apps with kotlin for android, part of #30DaysOfKotlin created by google developer
training program.

### Lesson 1: Build your first app
Lesson 1 teaches you how to set up Android Studio to use Kotlin and how to build apps. You start
with "Hello World" and move up to an app that uses image files and a click handler. You learn how
Android projects are structured, how to use and modify views in your Kotlin Android app, and how to
 make sure your apps are backward-compatible. You also learn about API levels and the Android
 Jetpack libraries.

### Lesson 2: Layouts
In Lesson 2, you learn how to use the Android Studio Layout Editor to create linear layouts and
constraint layouts. You create apps that get and display user input, respond to user taps, and
change the visibility and color of views. This lesson also teaches you how to use data binding to
eliminate inefficient calls to the findViewById() method.

#### 2.1 Linear layout using the Layout Editor
#### 2.2 Add user interactivity
#### 2.3 Constraint layout using the Layout Editor
#### 2.4 Data-binding basics

### Lesson 3: Navigation
In Lesson 3, you learn how to create useful navigation in an app. You create a fragment and add it
to an app, then add navigation to the app using the Android Studio navigation graph. You add a
navigation drawer and an options menu to your app, and you work with the app's back stack, changing
 the destination of the system Back button. Finally, you learn how to invoke an external activity
 from within the app.

#### 3.1: Create a fragment
#### 3.2: Define navigation paths
#### 3.3: Define external activities

### Lesson 4: Activity and fragment lifecycles
In Lesson 4, you learn about the activity and fragment lifecycles, and you learn how to manage
complex lifecycle situations. You work with a starter app that contains several bugs related to the
Android lifecycle. You add logging to the app to better understand the app's lifecycle events, and
you fix the bugs that the app contains and add some enhancements to the app. You also learn about
Android Jetpack's lifecycle library, which can help you manage lifecycle events with code that's
better organized and easier to maintain.
