## GoogleDeveloperTraining-AndroidKotlinFundamentalApps
Build fundamental apps with kotlin for android, part of #30DaysOfKotlin created by google developer
training program.

### Lesson 1: Build your first app
Lesson 1 teaches you how to set up Android Studio to use Kotlin and how to build apps. You start
with "Hello World" and move up to an app that uses image files and a click handler. You learn how
Android projects are structured, how to use and modify views in your Kotlin Android app, and how to
 make sure your apps are backward-compatible. You also learn about API levels and the Android
 Jetpack libraries.
